### April 2

Landing in Edinburgh was fine, though I was once again surprised by the lack of jetways. I was also surprised - though it's obvious in retrospect - that instead of going through international (EU) arrivals to the UK like I would have expected, there was a separate line for the soft border between Ireland and the UK. Felt weird arriving without getting a passport stamp, but hey, no lines!

I grabbed my luggage and hopped on the express bus to Edinburgh's center. Upon arriving, I was completely blown away by the - and I'll use this word a lot on this trip, between here, Venice, and Porto - the _topology_ of the city. Edinburgh is basically built around a huge hill upon which Edinburgh Castle sits, at the end of the main street of its Old Town. The Old Town rises far above the area around it, including where the bus dropped me off, on one of the main streets of the New Town. The new town is big and flat, and full of modern shopping and retail brands, while the Old Town is the tourist center and full of shops where you can buy tartans and whatnot.

The first view off the bus was ridiculous, though I poorly captured the scale of it here:

This is the view of Princes Street Gardens, which is a huge valley between the New Town and the Old Town. The buildings in the background are essentially the north edge of the Old Town. I was heading towards my hostel, so I walked up [The Mound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mound), an artificial hill built in the valley that serves as a bridge between the New Town and the Old Town.

Edinburgh has a lot of tiny pedestrian streets, with steep stairs running down alleys through buildings. Google Maps thankfully knows about these little paths, and gives pretty great walking directions that get you places much faster than following the roads would.

The stairs took me right up to the Royal Mile, the main street of the Old Town.

At this point, I realized I was incredibly, hungry, and before heading to my hostel, I headed over to Oink, a pork sandwich shop that's a local chain that came highly recommended.

With sandwich in hand, I headed back up to the hostel, which I found was, well, as advertised:

The hostel was probably the best-located I stayed at on my trip, and also just one of my favorites. It was rather cheap - 25 GBP a night for a 6 bed room - and had a solid kitchen, social events every night, and mostly friendly people. My room had a comfy bed and a great view of the castle.

The weather, if you hadn't noticed from the pictures, was pretty miserable, but I wanted to wander around at least a bit, so I walked down the Royal Mile and looked at some of the tourist shops. On the way back up, I went in a little tourist tavern and had "haggis bonbons," which were honestly pretty good!

I hung out at my hostel for a few hours, then found myself hungry again. Luckily for me, there was a 24/7 kebab shop nearby, though getting there was hilarious. The hostel is built into the side of a cliff, and while the street level entrance is on the top of the cliff, the kebab shop was at the bottom on the other side of the building. Turns out, there is a _massive_ staircase just to the left leaving the hostel that takes you down to the bottom of the cliff, and the kebab shop. Getting down was easy, getting up was rough.

Then I went out with folks I'd met at the hostel for hostel-organized pub trivia. The pub nearby kinda sucked, and the trivia was really bad, but we got a free drink, so eh. We also walked to a place next door advertising free live music, where we found... a band doing a folk cover of Toto's Africa. It was an appropriately surreal way to end the night.
